            <p>Have you been diagnosed with cancer? Nobody would want this even in their worst dreams. The fact, however, is that today's lifestyle has increased the chances of getting cancer. Worse, there are over a 100 types of cancers and any part of the body can be affected. Further, anyone can fall victim to this deadly disease.</p>
            <p>
                  'Given the high cost of treating cancer and the reasonable premium rates at which these plans are available, one should opt for a cover at the earliest,' says Mahavir Chopra

            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, while the probability of getting cancer has increased substantially, the cost of treatment has also gone up many-fold in recent years. In fact, treatment costs now have the potential to wipe out a common man's entire life saving. Worse, the cost of treating cancer abroad can be several times that incurred in India, according to a Times of India report. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the reason why A cancer policy has the potential to soften the financial blow in case the disease strikes.  Please find the enclosed HDFC CANCER CARE policy details. Cost of policy is very low.
